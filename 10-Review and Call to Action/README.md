## Learning Objectives

* Play around with the terminal APIs
* Colorize some text using ANSI escape codes
  * They look incredibly confusing at first, but once you practice with them, they become easier
* Draw some boxes, and get familiar with unicode characters
* Use the terminal UI examples that we discussed earlier as inspiration to build something yourself
* What problems are you trying to solve? What tools would help you be more productive?
* Some ideas of my own:
  * Command line social media client (Twitter, Facebook)
  * Task manager / system monitor
  * Weather report
  * System metrics monitor
